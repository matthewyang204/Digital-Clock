# Digital_Clock
This clock opens in a separate window on your desktop. It can only be used to check the time, and it displays time in military format. It is only fully compatible with Unix systems. It may partially work with Windows, but there might be bugs and it might crash you system. So do not try to use this with Windows unless you understand the risks. Also, there is a light and a dark version. Make sure to check your settings and make sure it is either theme before you download the correct version.
